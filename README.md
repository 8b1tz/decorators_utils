math_class
==========
This project consists of a collection of Python classes that provide functionalities related to mathematical concepts. Below is a brief explanation of each of the available classes:

### ComplexNumber

The `ComplexNumber` class represents complex numbers. A complex number is composed of a real part and an imaginary part. The class offers methods to perform operations with complex numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, among others.

### Equation

The `Equation` class models mathematical equations. It can be used to represent linear, quadratic, or polynomial equations of higher degrees. The class offers methods to solve the equation, find its roots, and calculate other parameters associated with the equation.

### Geometry

The `Geometry` class provides functionalities to deal with geometric objects such as circles, rectangles, triangles, and other shapes. It offers methods to calculate areas, perimeters, volumes, and other properties of these geometric objects.

### Matrix

The `Matrix` class represents numerical matrices. It offers methods to perform basic matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, transposition, determinant calculation, inversion, among others.

### Polynomial

The `Polynomial` class models mathematical polynomials. A polynomial is a mathematical expression composed of a sum of terms, where each term is a product of a constant and a variable raised to an integer power. The class offers methods to evaluate the polynomial, calculate its roots and derivatives, among other operations.

### Vector

The `Vector` class represents mathematical vectors. A vector is a mathematical entity that has magnitude and direction. The class offers methods to perform vector operations such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product, cross product, among others.

decorator
==========

This project contains a set of Python decorators that offer additional functionalities to your functions. Below is a brief explanation of each decorator:

### Call Counter Decorator

The `call_counter_decorator` counts the number of times a function is called and prints the count to the console. It's useful for tracking the frequency of function calls during program execution.

### Debugger Decorator

The `debugger_decorator` adds debugging capabilities to functions. It prints information about function arguments and return values, helping developers to debug their code effectively.

### Delay Decorator

The `delay_decorator` adds a delay before executing the decorated function. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to introduce a pause or wait before executing certain functions.

### Limited Call Function Decorator

The `limited_call_fun_decorator` restricts the number of times a function can be called. After reaching the specified limit, it raises an exception or performs a defined action, preventing the function from being called excessively.

### Register Decorator

The `register_decorator` registers functions in a central registry, allowing for easy access and management of functions across modules or components of an application.

### Rerun Fail Function Decorator

The `rerun_fail_func_decorator` automatically retries executing a function if it fails due to an exception. It provides a mechanism to handle transient errors and improve the robustness of the application.

### Timer Decorator

The `timer_decorator` measures the execution time of a function and prints the elapsed time to the console. It's helpful for performance profiling and optimization.

### Try-Catch Decorator

The `try_catch_decorator` wraps the decorated function in a try-catch block, allowing for centralized error handling and exception logging.

### Validate Params Decorator

The `validate_params_decorator` validates the parameters passed to a function against specified criteria. It helps enforce input validation and improve the reliability of functions.

## Usage

Each class has specific methods that can be used to perform relevant mathematical operations. Refer to the documentation and usage examples of each class to better understand how to take advantage of the offered functionalities.

Each decorator can be applied to functions to extend their behavior according to the described functionalities. Refer to the documentation and usage examples of each decorator to understand how to integrate them into your codebase effectively.
